# TimeBankingApp

This is an Android app produced by me and 3 other developers as a combined effort. The app handles a TimeBanking system, where users' accounts will not contain money but time and that time can be spent in order to ask other users to do some tasks using their skills.

## tecnologies used

This is an Android app developed for the most part in kotlin. The Jetpack navigation library is used to navigate among the different fragments. The app embeds a chat section, where Retrofit2 library is used in order to communicate with a backend server hosting the chatbot model. Kotlin coroutines are used as main a parallelization strategy. Finally Room library is used in order to store local data on an SQLite database.
Firebase database is used for storing data server-side.

## repository limits

This report is a temporary solution to show the work, while we figure out a way to securely publish the original repository with all the original commits. In fact some files have to be removed entirely from the original repository's history (as the original repo was not intended to be public in the first place).
